# FastAPI Cookiecutter Template: Your API Launchpad ðŸš€

This template streamlines your FastAPI development, providing a robust foundation built on best practices.

## Features

* **Modern Structure:** Organized project layout for easy navigation and scaling.
* **Essential Dependencies:** Includes FastAPI, uvicorn, pytest (for testing), and pydantic (for data validation).
* **Environment Management:** Preconfigured with Poetry for virtual environments and dependency management.
* **API Routing:** Sample `/healthcheck` endpoint.
* **Testing Framework:** Pytest for writing and running automated tests.
* **Linting:** Pre-commit hooks with Black for consistent code formatting.
* **Logging:** Structured logging with Loguru for better debugging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* **Cookiecutter:** `pip install cookiecutter`
* **Python:** (Preferably using pyenv for managing multiple Python versions)
* **Poetry:** `pip install poetry`
* **Git:** For version control
* **(Optional) Cruft:** For managing Cookiecutter templates more efficiently (not strictly required)
